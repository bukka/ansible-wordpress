## Customized WordPress + Nginx + PHP-FPM Deployment

- Requires Ansible 1.2 or newer
- Expects AWS

This is a customized WordPress deployment. It's meant mainly for my
sites but might be helpful for someone else. The WordPress site
is a multisite. All the main configuration for WordPress is encrypted
but anyone can replace it with their code if they want to.

It is original based on ansible examples to have it more quickly
done but it was considerably customized for my sites.
